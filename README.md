# Project Overview

**Sopaana** is hackathon project in which I developed a npm library - **bsvdata** which allows users to upload data (rows) from a .csv file into BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) Network. 


## Website

[Block Data](https://block-data.netlify.app/) <br>
The user can see the data corresponding to transaction hash (txid) using the above website.


## Objective

1. The purpose of this project is to reduce the dependency on web2 ecosystem like use of central servers and database management system.
2. To demonstrate the tech-enthusiast and developer that how data-integrity and data-safety can be achieved by leveraging the use of BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision).
